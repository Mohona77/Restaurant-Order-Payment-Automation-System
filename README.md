# Restaurant-Order-&-Payment-Automation-System
This project is a Restaurant Order & Payment Automation System that uses:

1. Singleton: To ensure a single instance of the Menu Manager, preventing duplication.

2. Factory: To dynamically create Order Objects (e.g., Dine-in, Takeaway, Delivery) for extensibility.

3. Observer: To notify customers and staff in real-time about order status updates.

4. Strategy: To implement flexible payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, Cash, Online) by encapsulating algorithms.

5. Adapter: To integrate third-party payment gateways seamlessly into the system.

6. Decorator: To add additional features (e.g., discounts, special requests) to orders dynamically without altering their core structure.
   
These patterns ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and flexible, making it easy to adapt to future changes.
